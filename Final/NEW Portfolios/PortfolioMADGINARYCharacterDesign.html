      <h2>Bluebird Mach 1</h2>
      <p>
          This character is a first in a series. I often design characters for a fantasy setting, but this character takes a more sci-fi turn. Bluebird is an expirement, made by a classic evil scientist. He has a total of 5 successful projects, with Bluebird being his most recent. This design in particular pushed my artistic skills, mainly the hair style I chose. This character has 8 different braids, which proved challenging to work with in terms of composition. Still, Bluebird has a very close place in my heart.</p>

    <h2>Bluebird Mach 2</h2>
    <p>
        This is the second "redesign" for Bluebird. She has a new found confidence as her story develops and she understands who she is. I designed a new powersuit for her due to her slowly regaining memories of her life before she was experimented on, and her better understanding her powers. This suit has a ton of small details, such as Bluebird's original name, Ava, displayed on her jacket, and the 5 streaks of color in her hair to represent each of the other "birds" as I call them. I also pushed her hair further, drawing 10 braids laid out to give the illusion of a ponytail. Even in the labeling, her experiment number drops as she takes back Bluebird to be a name for herself rather than a label.</p>

  <div id="CanaryDESC">
  <h2>Canary</h2>
  <p>
      Canary is the 2nd in this series, being the experiment just before Bluebird. Each of the birds have a power related to energy generation, and Canary's is electricity. She is very explosive with her powers, which is contrasted by her surpressed emotions due to being under control by her maker. Her design helped me set the rules for each bird, mainly how each bird will have one main color, an energy core in their torso, and some sort of hair and eye color matching their main colors.</p>

<h2>Flamingo</h2>
<p>
    Flamingo is one of my favorites in this series. Her power stems from hydro-energy, and small details can be seen with that in mind, like her suit almost being a container for the water she controls. The pink parts of her suit has a water texture to push this feel further. I also wanted to mess with how a water themed design could break away from curvy shapes and the cool colors that they usually use.</p>

<div id="HummingbirdDESC">
<h2>Hummingbird</h2>
<p>
  Hummingbird is the last-ish bird I have worked on. He has a very interesting torso, considering its absent. This was one of the first time I have pushed the structure of the body into a more robotic realm. I also had to mess with how he looks compared to the other birds, since he is the first technical experiement in their story. I opted for a more aged looking metal color, as well as some dated looking tech to mix with the more advanced powers he has.</p>

<div id="SabrewingDESC">
<h2>Sabrewing</h2>
<p>
  Sabrewing is one of the only birds who I redesigned from scratch. His original design did not fit with the rest of the birds, feeling more like a fantasy monk than an expiremental energy generator. I changed mainly how he uses his power, which is "fuel". He used to be able to light it at will, but instead, I made it so he lights it using the metal in his boots to generate sparks. This, combined with a spinal modification meant to always oxiginate the fuel, makes it so he is able to use his powers even in space.</p>

        I create art that is full of color, as I feel that color is the way of life. Color is rooted in our beings, and can have just as strong of symbolism as any other graphic. Color is gender, sexuality, religion, ethnicity, ability, and our own mind and souls.</p>

          <h2>Discordia</h2>
          <p>
              Discordia is themed around the Roman goddess of the same name. She is the goddess of chaos, and I wanted to play with what chaos was. Her body is covered in swirling patterns that glow, as if under black light. She seems to be a phantom, only appearing in darkness. I took a lot of inspiration from sleep paralysis and the hard-to-make-out halucinations that come with it.</p>
