      <h2>Gamma Phi Circus Show Logo 2024</h2>
      <p>
          Each year, Illinois State University's Gamma Phi Circus holds a design contest among its members in order to pick the show's logo. The 2023-2024 school year, my logo was selected. We had a lot of past logos with sillouettes of people on them in my years of being involved, so I took my logo into a more word logo direction.</p>

    <h2>HitPoints</h2>
    <p>
        Hit Points was a branding project in my final year of undergrad. This is only a snippet of the branding made for it, but its my favorite pieces of the project. This took a large part of the semester, about 80% of it. I wanted to create a brand thats focus was bringing in eductaional content to the esports scene. The focus was on how to better oneself in playing, coaching, or advertising esports, using content generated by the online community. To motivate others to create content, Hit Points would send out gear to help in content creation, hence the packaging and letterhead.</p>

        <p>This project was a harder one for me, since I am used to very fast design work. I had to force myself to slow down and really process each choice. This was also the first time I used photoshop in order to modify mock-ups. Overall, this project was challenging and I learned a lot from it, but I don't know if timespans of multiple months are my area of focus. I much prefer the short term.</p>

  <h2>Typographical Poster S</h2>
  <p>
     This was one of my first ever projects in undergrad, and it still is one of my favorites. We were asked to explore letters as symbols, and how to position and create unique compositions within a limited image. I learned so much in this first lession, both with art itself and with the adobe suite. I still go back to this exercise when I am stuck at a roadblock.</p>

<h2>Pokemon Type Magic Circles</h2>
<p>
    Pokemon has been a huge influence on my life since I was 8. During the pandemic, both Pokemon and Netflix were my ways to pass time. While watching Cardcaptor Sakura, a 90s anime, I had the idea to combine magic circle designs with each pokemon type. I came up with a total of 16 circles, but this is one of my personal favorites. I Overall, it was a very relaxing project that proved to be intresting to explore.</p>

<h2>3 Color Stickers</h2>
<p>
  Believe it or not, all of these stickers were made using only 3 colors. In fact, its the three colors I mainly used on this website, #2C363F, #EF7171, and #FBD87F. This project was to create a sticker sheet using only 3 colors, but there were no limitations on layer styles. So, to render my characters cohesively but in their own colors, I simply would layer different colors and layer styles until I liked the result. This project was a great one for me to push the guidelines a bit and really see what I could do to adapt to limited colors.</p>
  <p>Each character is one I designed. In order, there is Phoebe, Myros, Catreia, Cynder, Seirilith, and Amber. I chose these 6 based on close ties to aspects of my own personality and identity.</p>
