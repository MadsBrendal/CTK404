    <h2>Mads Brendal: They/Them</h2>
    <p id="About">
        I create art that is full of color, as I feel that color is the way of life. Color is rooted in our beings, and can have just as strong of symbolism as any other graphic. Color is gender, sexuality, religion, ethnicity, ability, and our own mind and souls.</p>
        <p id="About2">
            I use my experiences to impact others. I have been a clown in a circus, a colorguard performer, a wire walker, and a bike flyer. I also am a friend to someone who is blind, which they still impact how I myself see the world and its accessability issues. They helped me realize how I can make my work aid those who need the extra assistance when it comes to the world of art and design.</p>
