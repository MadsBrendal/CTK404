      <h2>Glass Snake: Strangle</h2>
      <p>
         This was my first ever project in glass. We were given a tile project where we could pick what shape our tile was. I asked my professor to pour a random shape on the floor for my tile, and I had to work with whatever I was given. When I first saw it, I noticed a hole that I could fit my thumb through, and grab the tile. I decided to make a snake, so it was as if I was grabbing the snake around the neck. It took 12 hours of dremmeling, and a really sore wrist, but it was worth it.</p>

    <h2>Mimic</h2>
    <p>
       We were tasked in one of my classes to create a "consensual vandalism" type project, so I asked a local game store, Red Racoon, if I would be able to decorate their dice aquarium by using vinyl to turn it into a mimic, a dnd monster. They gave me permission! I made 13 layers of vinyl, measured to the tank, and stuck it to the aquarium myself. It still is up currently!</p>
