      <h2>Fairy Globe</h2>
      <p>
         This piece came from no where. I had no class or project in mind when making this, but it just happened to be what I drew that particular day. I go back to this piece a lot, as it was the start of my current style. I still alter some stuff as I go and create, but this piece was a foundation to me and my style.</p>

    <h2>Doll Study</h2>
    <p>
       Part of my hobbies is doll collecting. One series I collect has very unique clothing per doll, so to get better at absract and wild clothing, I decided to draw each of my dolls as a study. I have 6 of the 19 done, but at the time of this specific drawing, I only owned 6. I really enjoy how this doll line plays with color, and using a real life object in-the-round as a reference rather than images.</p>

  <h2>Winx Club Tarot Deck</h2>
  <p>
     I personally am a Pagan, and read tarot. I wanted to make a major arcana only deck of the Winx Club, a show I used to watch as a kid. This sparked a lot of my intrest in magic, and fantasy in general. I use the form that, in the show, is earned via saving someone or multiple people from their home planet. I did this for an intention of protection and guardianship to be placed into the deck as I drew it.</p> <p>I have a list of what character represents which card, with reasons as to why I chose each. For example, Bloom is the Magician due to her origin story, and Flora is the Empress based on her growth in character and skill.</p>

<h2>Poison Type Personified</h2>
<p>
   One of the on going projects I use to prevent art block is drawing each Pokemon type as a person and representing underrepresented people as I do. This was the first work in the series. I aimed for a more urban art feel of poison, and less so into the pollution type like the Pokemon series does. I wanted to also experiment with wild colors, like toxic frogs and flowers in the wild.</p>
